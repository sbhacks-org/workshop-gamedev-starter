## Running a Local Server
In order to get the Phaser starter code working locally, you'll need to have a local web server running. We can do this easily with Python. First, use your terminal/command prompt to enter into the source code directory, then run:
- With python2, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- With python3, use `python -m http.server 8000`
